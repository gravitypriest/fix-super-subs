# fix-super-subs
Fix dub names and inconsistencies in Toei's DB Super subtitles

### Requires
- Python

## Usage
Place fix_super_subs.py in a directory with *.ass subtitles for DB Super, then run it with `python fix_super_subs.py`

The script assumes the first number in the filename to be the episode number, e.g. in `Dragon Ball Super - 65.ass`, "65" would be the episode number.
